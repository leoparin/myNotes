>explain:不同爱好获得不一样的技能，愿意投入更多时间
>example：弹钢琴提高专注力，绘画提高审美，体育提高合作能力
>extra：适应能力比较强，工作中遇到问题可以解决
>>With greater freedom,children can ==acquire a great variety of skills== as they can choose their subjects,hobbies and extracurricular activities freely.The ==expansion of the skills set== is important in a competitive world,where jobs have become more demanding in the workplace.Children who make decisions freely are willing to put extra time and effort in their choices,thereby improving skills and abilities accordingly.Examples include piano lessons that ==improve concentration==, painting classes tha ==enhance visual literacy== and sport that can make them ==good team players==. Those who have various skills are more resilent in the workplace as they are able to solve complex problems.

>>On the other hand, the school chiledren who get more freedom might lack supervision,which will develop miss behaviours.Because young children cannot tell right from wrong like adults ,and if they have too much freedom,they may repeat their wrong behaviors.If they keep wrong screentime,acts of violence and verbal abuse ,which will have a bad influence on their academic performance,eventually they might lead to criminal offences.
>>On the other hand,if freedom is not restricted,children tend to misbehave due to the lack of parental and school discipline.Behavioural problems can happen frequently for the simple reason that many children lack self-discipline.These behavioural problems are more likely to persist since nobody educates children to tell right from wrong.If adults do not correct problems such as long screen time,acts of violence ,cheating in exams or verbal abuse,these habits can affect their academic performance and job prospects or even evolve into criminal offences.

### 3.1.4 结尾：
> end:In conclusion,giving children considerable freedom can benefit them,but excessive freedom can have its consequence.

> my:Recently,some people hold the view that the government should decrease the violent behaviours in the films to decrease ciminal rate.In my opinion,although the street fighting in the films might lead people to behave aggressive,decreasing agression in films would also bring a lot of problems.
> 
>> gu:Imposing restrictions on violent images in the media is considered to be a solution to violent crime in society.I partly agree with this view although this should be combined with other efforts.

### 3.2.3 主体段
1. 我的观点：
- A减少暴力影片 B避免人们习得暴力(减少接触) C减少犯罪

**background:**
生活压力大，不满意，希望发泄
对年轻人有用，年轻人缺乏对世界的认知
**explain:**
-（b-c）减少模仿，不会觉得有矛盾时暴力是一种方法
-（b-c）不会觉得暴力是正常行为
> The violent behaviours maybe reduced ,if the government minimise the aggression in the films,which will reduce the exposure of people to the violence.Nowadays,people ofen want to release their negative emotions because of the high pressure world.Because young people can not fully aware of the world,censoring the aggression in films is of vital importance to them.And if people don't see aggression too much,they will reduce imitate.And when they confront to the contradiction,they won't see aggressive behaviour as a normal method.
>>Censoring media violence can help prevent violent crime as it can reduce people 's exposure to violent imagery.This approach can minimise the influence of violence on behaviour in this stressful world,where people look for outlets to release their nagative emotions.This is true for young people,who are not fully aware of the difference between televised violence and real life/fiction and reality.If the government regulates media content,they will not have any role model in movies or TV programmes that they can imitate using violence to settle conflicts.Nor will they regard aggressive behaviour in the real world
- A B妨碍创作自由 C增加犯罪
2. eg:
- A控制媒体 B减少接触 C减少犯罪
- A国家控制媒体 B 不加大惩罚力度 C还是不能降低社会犯罪
**background**:有些犯罪不是要泄愤，而是为了钱
举例：抢劫，绑架，勒索
**explain：**
（b-c）：有威慑力，人们不敢去犯罪，因为他们接受不了后果
（b-c）：屡次犯罪的人不能再伤害别人
对比：如果世界上大部分的犯罪不是媒体造成的，那么效果不好
>On the other hand,if the government get control of the media and don't pass strict laws,people might still commit crimes.Because some people who assult others physically are aim at money,such as robbing and staking.But if the government impose severe punishment,people might can not bare the consequence and then would not dare to behave aggressively.And those break the laws for several times might be controled by the police and not be a threat to the public.
>>On the other hand,controling the media may not reach its goal since the government does not pass the strict laws to punish the ==offenders==.This is understandable in cases where people commit violent crime,such as robberies,kidnapping and balackmailing,not to vent anger but for financial gains.Tougher laws can deter violent behaviour for the simple reason that they cannot ==take consequences== such as a ==long prison term==.The court can also send the repeat offenders to the prison/impose a long prison sentence on repeat offenders,thereby preventing them from committing crime to hurt others.In conrast,imposing restrictions on televised violence may not ahieve he same effect,if the majority of crime is not related to the media


- A加强教育 B引导人们规范行为 C···

### 3.2.4 结尾
> In conclusion,I agree that restricting violence in the media may be helpful,especially for young viewers,but for poverty-induced crime,imposing hatsh punishment can be more effective.

explain（a-b）：告诉学生同一个事情的不同看法和解释。让他们知道不同的可能性
b-c:随着环境改变，学生知道怎么做更合适
embody:对于提高积极性有很多理论，管理者、教室等学习了这些理论，才唔够更加清楚具体的方法和操作在什么请开给你下使用更加恰当
对比：只是学习了实践课，有时候照搬，不管环境改变，效果不好
> College students will have critical thinking and know how to practice better if they are taught theory-oriented classes.For example,there are a lot of theories about improving motivations.And those managors and teachers who havlearned these theories can know when and where to make better choices in practice.

> gu:Delivering theory-venterd courses enables pople to make better choices in the workplace,since they are able to think critically.These classes can teach students many different theories about the same topics or matters,==thereby allowing== them to know more possibilities in seemingly similar situations.Those who ==have theoretical knowledge== know how to react to changing contexts.For example,theories related to motivations can help them understand what pratices they can adopt to keep employees or students motivated in different circumstances ==if they== work as businesss managers and teachers.In contrast.those ==who attend== practical courses only may copy what they learn at university blindly,regardless of environment changes,==thereby failing== to achieve expected outcomes.

explain(a-b):人们知道基本规律。利用只是解决问题。设计大量的调查和实验
b-c：利用这样的知识解决问题

> Those who have learned enough subjects that impart theoretical knowledge can also come up with innovations and can push back boundaries of knowledge/subject.Those who are faimilar with compounds' chemical properties can synthesize many componends to satisfy their needs.
> 
> gu:Theoretical courses can also help push back ==boundaries of knowledge== as people are more capabe of ==coming up with innocaitons==.These subjects procide information/give an insight into the inner mechanisms of the natural world and how humans behave,for the simple reson that these courses involve enormous research and experimentation.They apply such knowledge to solving some problems creatively,such as an in-depth knowledge of properties of materials and chemicals that leads to the invention of compounds to satisfy various needs.By comparison,students who attend practical courses can handle familiar matters only as their knowledge is fixed.
