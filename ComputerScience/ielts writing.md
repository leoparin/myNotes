### 1.1.5 dynamic 5
The four charts compares the units of electricity generated by different resources in Australia and Franch in 1980 and 2000.

The amount of electricity produced by coal was the highest in Australia, and saw a significant increase to 130 units in 2000.

The figure for coal in Franch was much lower at 25 units in 1980, and stood at this level in 2000.

There was a dramaticly increase of electricity generated by nuclear power in Franch, from 25 units to 126 units, and had become the most important resources in 2000.

The usage in electricity generation of other three resources was much lower.

The amount of electricity created by oil saw a decrease in Australia to 2 units in 2000, while Franch saw a rise to 25 units.

The figure for natual gas showed the same trend in these two countries, dropping to 2 units.

The figure for hydro power increase from 20 to 36 units, although it was rather lower in France(only 2 units in 2000).

Overall,  Australia relied more on core than any other energy source, and in France, nuclear power was the primary source. The amount of electricity generated by these two fuels increased.

The figure for Italy can see a same pattern, and is expected to decrease from 14.3% in 200 to 11.5% in 2050.

The proportion of people aged 15-59 saw a different trend in Yemen, increasing from 46.3% to 57.3%, and will become the largest of all three age groups.

But the figure in Italy wil drop significantly, from 61.6% to 46.2%.

In Yemen, the percentage of senior citizens who aged over 69 will see a slight rise form 3.6% to 5.7%.

The increase of older people in Italy will even bigger(form )

Overall, the percentage of people of 14 in two countries is likely to see a decrease, while the percentage of elderly people (aged 60 or older) is expected to become bigger. Those aged 15-59 are projected to make up a bigger proportion of Yemen's population than other two age groups, while in Italy, the over-60s may constitute the biggest.

both countries are projected to see their population grow older in 200, with a smalller proportion of those under the age of 14 and a larger proportion of those aged 60 or 
above.In spite of these changes, the projection is that the 15-59 age group will be the biggest one in both countries.

The chart compares the proportion of male and female students who enrolled in different subjects in 1995 in Australia.

The bar chart shows the proportions of men and women who studied different subjects in 1995.

The percentage of males attracted by engineering was the highest among all subjects(around 19%), while females who studied                      

The percentage of female who participated in arts and humanities was the highest, at around 19%, compared to their conterparts at around 13%.

The biggest gender gap can saw in the figure of students who chose health,with 15% of females and 4% of males.

While nearly 10% and 8% females studied education and business, only 6% and 7% males were attracted by these subjects.

The other subjects can saw different pattern.

Engineering was the most popular choice of men(18%),and the women who attracted by this subject only accounted for 3%.

The percentage of male students who chose computer and mathes and sciences were higher than their counterpart,(10% and 18% for men, 4% and 6% for women.

(in summary,for summaries)
Overall, Engineering was the top choice for male students, whereas arts and humanities attracted most females.Women were more likely than men to study Education, Health and Business studies, and a different pattern was seen in other subjects.

Similarly around 13% of men studied Maths and Sciences, around twice as high as the figure for women.

The similar pattern was seen in 

The proportion of boys who chose was similar to the figure for girls(23% and 24% respectively)

### 1.1.9 static 2
The two charts give the proportion of reasons for land degradation worldwide and compare the figures of three different areas.

Over-grazing was the main factors why agricultual land becomes less productive(over one third).

And deforestation and over-cultivation were also important reason for the land degradation worldwide(30% and 28% respectively).

The remaining 7% was caused by other factors.

Europe had the highest proportion of land degraded (23%),compared with 5% of North America and 13% of Oceania.

Deforestation was the main reason caused European's land degradation(9.8%),higher than the factors of other two regions (0.2% and 7% respectively).

There was a similar patterns in over-cultivation: the figure in European was higher than in other two regions.

While the Oceania had the highest percentage of land becomes less productive caused by over-gazing(11.3%),the figures for other regions were lower.

Overall,over-grazing is the primary reason for worldwide land degradation.European had a higher proportion of degraded land than other two rigions in th**e 1990s,and the main contributor of land degradation differed in these regions.

### 1.1.10 static 3
The two charts give the information of the factors which students set priority to and the percentage of students who receive help from their employers.

The proportion of students aged under 26 who considered career as the most important reason for study was the highest at about 80%, and much higher than people who study for interst in the same age group (10%).

The figure for career-driven education dropped with the age and reached 40%, almost the same as their counterparts studying for personal interests.

And the percentage of people who driven by their own interest saw a different pattern, and climbed to 70% in the over 49-year-old group.

Employers had an intense interest to fund young generations aged under 26(around 62%), and was the highest among all age groups.

The figure for students aged 30-39 year-old was the lowest(around 30%).

The porportion of people received support from their employers saw a decrease from 62% of under 26 age group to 30% of age 30-39, and then increased to 40% of age over 49.

Overall, young people aged under 26 were more likely to study for career than their counterparts. The likelihood of gainning assistance from employers was also relatively high before people turned 30.



### 1.1.11 process1
The charts show how cement is produced and how it is used to create concrete.

In the first step,limestone and clay are sent to the crusher to create powder in the production of cement.
The first step of cement production is 

The powder is then mixed in a mixer.

Next, the mixture is then goes through a rotating heater, which is heated with a device at the bottom, and then falls onto a conveyor belt.

At the end of the belt,the mixture is ground by a grinder to create cement, which is packaged by bags.

As shown in the second graph, cement represent 15% of the raw material of concrete production, while water, sand and small stones make up 10%, 25% and 50% respectively. All these materials are blended in a concrete mixer, which rotates clockwise until concrete is made. It is a simple, two-step procedure.

To summarise, cement production consists of five steps, and its final product is combined with other ingredients to manufacture concrete. The former process is much more complex, as it involves the use of various devices and facilities. 

### 1.1.12 process2
The chart illustrates the whole process of using geothermal power to generate electricity.

The first step of electricity production is to pump cold water which is hold in a container down to a 4.5km long injection well.

And then the water is injected to the geothermal zone which contains hot rocks to generate the hot water.

After the water is heated, it is sent to a production well.

Eventually, the hot water is pumped up to a upground condenser to produce steam.
where it becomes steam.

The rest of the process is how to use the steam to generate electricity.

Firstly, the steam reaches to a turbine and runs it.

And the turbine drives the generator to produce electricity.

Finally, the electricity reaches the tower and sent to users' homes.

In short, electricity is made from geothermal power by the process of pumping water deep underground where it's heated, and then pumping it back up where the steam created indirectly powers a generator to create electricity.

### 1.1.13 process（生物生长）

The graphs shows how salmon move through different stages of their lifecycle.

At the first stage, salmon lay eggs in the slow-moving upper river. 
The eggs will spend 5-6 months and then the little fishes break the eggs and go down to the lower river which flow fast. 
At this stage,they are called fry and measured 3-8 cm long. 
And they spend around 4 years there, untill they become 12-15cm long.

They are also known as smolt at this stage.

At the maturation stage, salmon travel to open seas and spend 5 years there, during this period they grow into maturity. The size of an adult salmon is 70-76cm, around six time as much as that of smolt. The maturity salmon swim back to the upper river ,where their life begins, to deposit eggs. The cycle thus begins anew.

Overall, the whole life cycle of salmon consists of four stages and sees significant changes in the aquatic locations where they live, from fresh water in the first stages and then saltwater in the third.

The two images shoe the changes of an island for tourism.

The island was previously empty without any man-made structures, but now, a number of key facilities have been made available for visitors.

There is a restaurant in the middle of the island, conneted to its reception with a vehicle track.

Two clusters of accomodation huts have been built in the east and west, connected with each other by footpaths

These footpaths also lead to two other new features of the island.

The first is the pier on the southern end, which allows boats to berth. This can make the island more accessible to tourists. The other is a swimming area neext to the beach on the western tip, attracting holidaymakers who are keen to take a dip. In contrast, the eastern part of the island remains basically undeveloped with nothing apart from trees. 

Overall, wile originally untouched, the island now has a variety of facilities which have been built to cater for the needs of touristsm usch as dinning,lodging,yacjting and swimming

The two pictures show the proposed changes to a town named Islip.

One major development, according to the plan,is the pedestrianisation of the main road which currently runs through the centre from west to east. 

Another principle change is that the building of a dual carriageway around the centre, which can divert traffic and make the central area pedestrian-only.

Another big change is that the shops on the north of the main road are planned to be demolished and make way for the bus station,shopping centre,car park and new housing. 

To the sourth of the bottom line of shops is a park, which is expected to be reduced in size to make room for new housing.

Finally, the school and housing on the southern edge of the centre are likely to remain,but outside the carriageway.

Overall, the major developments proposed to the Islip town centre include the construction of a new ring road and the pedestrianisation of the main road, which will lead to subsequent changes to transportation, shopping facilities and residential areas.

### 1.1.17 map small
The two pictures show the planned changes of a university's sports centre.

Currently, visitors canenter the centre from the north entrance and see the reception immediately. 

And there is a 25m pool right behind the reception, which connect to the changing room on the north and the seating area on the east.
And these will remain unchange,accroading to the plan.

The reception area is set to become bigger to  include a sports shop and a cafe.

At present, there are two outdoor court outside of the centre, but are planned to replaced to make room for the new sports centre, which is estimated to be three times bigger than the old one.

On the site of these courts, there are expected to be a leisure pool at the left wing, and two new dance studios and a sports hall in the east wing.

The gym in the north part of the sports centre, and will extended in the future.

There will also be two new changing room on the southeastern and sourthwestern part of the centre, which are aimed for satisfying potential demands.

Overall, the biggest change of the sports centre, according to the plan, is that the inner space is set to be extented, and set up couple of new facilities to satisfy people's need.And almost half of the old facilities will remain unchanged.

A healthy lifestyle is important because it can gives people a sense of dignity and a feeling of well-being.Although many people think they have the rights to choose their own lifestyle, I think they will not choose healthy lifestyles without the government intervennes.

Some people hold view that they will be happier if they can decide how to live a life.

They choose healthy habits which can make them enjoy their life.

For instance, some people preferto eat vegetables and fruit, which can help them keep fit, and they will be more confident in workplace and social life.

In contrast, if they are forced by the government's instruction to eat these food, this will become a burden to them.

On the other hand, some people think the government should impose restrictions on some behaviours which will harm health.

There are many people who lack self discipline.

To be specify
For example, they know that tabacco can be harmful to their fitness, but they keep smoking, even if they are already in bad health condition.

And they are not expected to quit smoking, unless the government imposes tax on tabacco and forbid citizens to smoke in public.

From my point of view, it is important for the authority to educate the public and provide the guideline.

With the government guideline, people will be awareness of their unhealthy lifestyles.

For instance, office workers are likely to take exercise, if the government launches campaigns to inform people the sedentary job can affect their health and reduce life expectancy.

Teh government should also offer information the health problems brought by fast food, so that people will choose healthier food and read the nutritional information on food packaging carefully.

Developed countries can provide technological aid, which can help deprived countries make their own technological advanced and eventually break the cycle of poverty.

Techonological development can be a great solution to the problem of poverty, because it can improve the productivity of the society.

To be specify, new fertilisers can hugely increase yields, which can provide food for more people. And medical advance can prevent people from dying helplessly. 

And the deprived countries may even gain advantage position in international trade beacause of technological advance.

In contrast, if those countries relay on financial aid, people would not feel obliged to grow the economy.

the mass use of machines can improve output of factories to ensure that high=quality pro

`Some people believe that professionals, such as doctors and engineers, should be required to work in the country where they did their training. Others believe they should be free to work in another country if they wish.
`Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.  
`Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.`

People should be free to choose the country where they want to work. I agree with this opinion, while other people argue that people should be required to work in the country where they receive training.

If people are required to work in their trained country, the country can prevent brain-drain, which will do good to the countries' economy. As we all know, people always want to work in the country which can offer higher salaries and provide more opportunities for people to advance their careers. This will cause the reduction of working people in the country where they get trained and may cause bad effect to the economy. So the policy can be a possible solution to it.

On the other hand, if people can feel free to choose countries to work in, they can show their talents and fulfill their careers. If people want to learn the most advanced technology in their industry, perhaps they should go to another country to learn and work. If the government ask them to stay in their home country, this will curb them achieve their career. For instance, if someone want to become the best programmer, you should work in the silicon valley, they offer the best opportuies.

Some people hold view that people who choose engineers and doctors as their professions should be asked to work in their trained country, but others argue that people can have the freedom to choose which country they want to work in. In my opinion, people can work in their country after graduation for a few years, then they can be free to choose other countries to work.
If people are asked to work in the country where they receive training, the country will have more working people, which can contribute to the country's economy development. People who attend the engineer or docter training are high-tech talents, so they can join their effort to advance their own industry of the country, and this will bring commercial profit to the country.
On the other hand, if people can feel free to choose counties to work, they can corporate with the doctors from other countires and learn through this process, which will do good to their career advancement.When people go to a new workplace which they are not familiar with, they will learn from local working people and read more materials to adapt to the new environment, and through this they can learn many practical skill which they are not taught in medical school, which will be benefit to their career success.
In my opinion, people should work in the place where they receive training for couple of years, then they can choose to work wherever they want. As we all know, higher education is a consume of the resource of the society, so people should serve the local place for couple of years to pay back, and they can also learn practical knowledge at the same time.
In summaries, people work in local place can contribute to the economy growth, and they can learn more by working in other countries.

The diagrams show the proposed changes to the Norbiton industrial area.

There used to be almost only factories in the central area of the town, but now, a number of key public facilities is planned to constructed. One of the main change is the road, according to the plan, which will be extended to the other side of the river to the farmland. There will be a new bridge be constructed on the river, which will bring convinence to the houseowners of the other side of the river.

There will be new shops and medical centre, as planning, situated in the centre of the town which used to be factories, and connected to the housing clusters through the vehicle path. And a new school and playground is planned to built on the northern wing of the town.

Overall, there will be more public facilities to replace the old factories, which will satisfy town dwellers' needs, such as education and medication.

The diagrams compare the changes to a public park between 1920 and today.
Visitors in 1920 could enter the park through sourth and north entrances and saw the fountain immediately, which has been removed to make room for a new rose garden. The new rose garden is surounded by four seats areas. To the west of the fountain, they could see a stage for musicians, and there were two rose gardens to the north and sourth of it.The rose gardens each had seats areas on the side. But now in the western of the park, there is a new amphitheatre which function is hold the concert, which replaced amost all old facilities in the western part except for the rose garden in the northern side.  
If the visitors turn to the east side of the park from the southern entrance in 1920, they would find a glasshouse on their right hand, with seats on its northeast. These were all deconstructed, and a water feature and underground park were created on the site. Rose garden and pond for water plants were on the northeast wing of the park, and have been replaced by a cafe and children play area.
Overall, there are much more new important facilities in the park today, which can bring convience to the local dwellers. And only one of the rose garden and two entrance remain unchanged.


Many advertisers today always use many methods to give people the information that their products are new. I think it is because people want buy new goods to satisfy their needs. And this is a negetive trend in most cases, but can benefit people sometimes.

People have earned more salaries than ever before, and they want new products to satisfy their needs, so businesses tend to emphasise their innovations. Because of the economic boom, people can make a decent living and have expire money to buy consumer goods to bring convinence to their lives. For instance, people buy cleaning robots to free themselves from the heavy housework, so they can spend more quality time with their families. As a result, advertisors who want to boost their sales are likely to give people details about the new functions of their products.

I think this is a negative trend because this will cause people's overconsumption of consumer goods, which might lead to environmental destruction. The advertisors always exaggerate their innovations, so many people buy products they do not really need. This will cause environmental pollution, because the production of the goods created greenhouse gases and the products eventually are thrown into landfill sites which will cause contamination of the soil nearby. 

But on the other hand, these advertisements can give those needy people infromation about the products which they need. In contrast, without these advertisements, people would be confuse about what products can meet their requirement.
In summaries, the increase of earnings cause advertisors emphasis their innovations, which is negative trend but still have its good aspects.

The diagram gives the information of the process of using sugar cane to producing sugar.
 The first step is the growing of sugar canes which will last 12-18 months long. And then the crops are havested by machines or manual. The havested sugar canes are sent to the crash machine to create juice,which will be pured to a container.
 
Here comes to the next stage: the juice is then purified by limestone filter. The purified juice is sent to a evaporator, which is heated on fire, to generate syrup subsequently. In the next step, the syrup will be sent to a centrifuge to separate sugar crystals. And finally, the sugar is created by drying and cooling the sugar crystals in a big bucket.
To summarise, sugar production consists of 7 steps. The sugar in sugar canes are converted to juice and then be purified evaporated and centifuged.
