### 1.1.5 static 1
The chart compares the proportion of male and female students who enrolled in different subjects in 1995 in Australia.

The percentage of female who participated in arts and humanities was the highest, at around 19%, compared to their conterpart at around 13%.

The biggest gender gap can saw in the figure of students who chose health,with 15% of females and 4% of males.

While nearly 10% and 8% females studied education and business, only 6% and 7% males were attracted by these subjects.

The other subjects can saw different pattern.

Engineering was the most popular choice of men(18%),and the women who attracted by this subject only accounted for 3%.

The percentage of male students who chose computer and mathes and sciences were higher than their counterpart,(10% and 18% for men, 4% and 6% for women.

(in summary,for summaries)
Overall, Engineering was the top choice for male students, whereas arts and humanities attracted most females.Women were more likely than men to study Education, Health and Business studies, and a different pattern was seen in other subjects.

Similarly around 13% of men studied Maths and Sciences, around twice as high as the figure for women.

The similar pattern was seen in 

The proportion of boys who chose was similar to the figure for girls(23% and 24% respectively)

### 1.1.6 static 2
The two charts give the proportion of reasons for land degradation worldwide and compare the figures of three different areas.

Over-grazing was the main factors why agricultual land becomes less productive(over one third).

And deforestation and over-cultivation were also important reason for the land degradation worldwide(30% and 28% respectively).

The remaining 7% was caused by other factors.

Europe had the highest proportion of land degraded (23%),compared with 5% of North America and 13% of Oceania.

Deforestation was the main reason caused European's land degradation(9.8%),higher than the factors of other two regions (0.2% and 7% respectively).

There was a similar patterns in over-cultivation: the figure in European was higher than in other two regions.

While the Oceania had the highest percentage of land becomes less productive caused by over-gazing(11.3%),the figures for other regions were lower.

Overall,over-grazing is the primary reason for worldwide land degradation.European had a higher proportion of degraded land than other two rigions in the 1990s,and the main contributor of land degradation differed in these regions.

### 1.1.7 process1
The charts show how cement is produced and how it is used to create concrete.

In the first step,limestone and clay are sent to the crusher to create powder in the production of cement.
The first step of cement production is 

The powder is then mixed in a mixer.

Next, the mixture is then goes through a rotating heater, which is heated with a device at the bottom, and then falls onto a conveyor belt.

At the end of the belt,the mixture is ground by a grinder to create cement, which is packaged by bags.

As shown in the second graph, cement represent 15% of the raw material of concrete production, while water, sand and small stones make up 10%, 25% and 50% respectively. All these materials are blended in a concrete mixer, which rotates clockwise until concrete is made. It is a simple, two-step procedure.

To summarise, cement production consists of five steps, and its final product is combined with other ingredients to manufacture concrete. The former process is much more complex, as it involves the use of various devices and facilities. 

### 1.1.8 process2
The chart illustrates the whole process of using geothermal power to generate electricity.

The first step of electricity production is to pump cold water which is hold in a container down to a 4.5km long injection well.

And then the water is injected to the geothermal zone which contains hot rocks to generate the hot water.

After the water is heated, it is sent to a production well.

Eventually, the hot water is pumped up to a upground condenser to produce steam.
where it becomes steam.

The rest of the process is how to use the steam to generate electricity.

Firstly, the steam reaches to a turbine and runs it.

And the turbine drives the generator to produce electricity.

Finally, the electricity reaches the tower and sent to users' homes.

In short, electricity is made from geothermal power by the process of pumping water deep underground where it's heated, and then pumping it back up where the steam created indirectly powers a generator to create electricity.

### 1.1.9 process（生物生长）

The graphs shows how salmon move through different stages of their lifecycle.

At the first stage, salmon lay eggs in the slow-moving upper river. 
The eggs will spend 5-6 months and then the little fishes break the eggs and go down to the lower river which flow fast. 
At this stage,they are called fry and measured 3-8 cm long. 
And they spend around 4 years there, untill they become 12-15cm long.

They are also known as smolt at this stage.

At the maturation stage, salmon travel to open seas and spend 5 years there, during this period they grow into maturity. The size of an adult salmon is 70-76cm, around six time as much as that of smolt. The maturity salmon swim back to the upper river ,where their life begins, to deposit eggs. The cycle thus begins anew.

Overall, the whole life cycle of salmon consists of four stages and sees significant changes in the aquatic locations where they live, from fresh water in the first stages and then saltwater in the third.

### 1.1.10 map1
The two images shoe the changes of an island for tourism.

The island was previously empty without any man-made structures, but now, a number of key facilities have been made available for visitors.

There is a restaurant in the middle of the island, conneted to its reception with a vehicle track.

Two clusters of accomodation huts have been built in the east and west, connected with each other by footpaths

These footpaths also lead to two other new features of the island.

The first is the pier on the southern end, which allows boats to berth. This can make the island more accessible to tourists. The other is a swimming area neext to the beach on the western tip, attracting holidaymakers who are keen to take a dip. In contrast, the eastern part of the island remains basically undeveloped with nothing apart from trees. 

Overall, wile originally untouched, the island now has a variety of facilities which have been built to cater for the needs of touristsm usch as dinning,lodging,yacjting and swimming.

### 1.1.11 map2 big
The two pictures show the proposed changes to a town named Islip.

One major development, according to the plan,is the pedestrianisation of the main road which currently runs through the centre from west to east. 

Another principle change is that the building of a dual carriageway around the centre, which can divert traffic and make the central area pedestrian-only.

Another big change is that the shops on the north of the main road are planned to be demolished and make way for the bus station,shopping centre,car park and new housing. 

To the sourth of the bottom line of shops is a park, which is expected to be reduced in size to make room for new housing.

Finally, the school and housing on the southern edge of the centre are likely to remain,but outside the carriageway.

Overall, the major developments proposed to the Islip town centre include the construction of a new ring road and the pedestrianisation of the main road, which will lead to subsequent changes to transportation, shopping facilities and residential areas.

### map small
The two pictures show the planned changes of a university's sports centre.

Currently, visitors canenter the centre from the north entrance and see the reception immediately. 

And there is a 25m pool right behind the reception, which connect to the changing room on the north and the seating area on the east.
And these will remain unchange,accroading to the plan.

The reception area is set to become bigger to  include a sports shop and a cafe.

At present, there are two outdoor court outside of the centre, but are planned to replaced to make room for the new sports centre, which is estimated to be three times bigger than the old one.

On the site of these courts, there are expected to be a leisure pool at the left wing, and two new dance studios and a sports hall in the east wing.

The gym in the north part of the sports centre, and will extended in the future.

There will also be two new changing room on the southeastern and sourthwestern part of the centre, which are aimed for satisfying potential demands.

Overall, the biggest change of the sports centre, according to the plan, is that the inner space is set to be extented, and set up couple of new facilities to satisfy people's need.And almost half of the old facilities will remain unchanged.
